# MobileServerHandler
This console application is written in Java. I have made a RoutingMapTree which handles all calls and lookups in a tree of BaseStations and Exchanges containing those BaseStations. This can simulate a mobile phone network with added capability of state checking of Mobile Phones (i.e. the phones are either on or off(or unavailable))
